1.  Introduction

   Knowledge graph introduces a new paradigm in data management that
   facilitates the integration of heterogenous data silos thanks to a
   semantic layer.  In the case of network management, knowledge graphs
   provide a data integration solution that can cope with the diverse
   network data sources and telemetry mechanisms
   [I-D.mackey-nmop-kg-for-netops].

   The construction of knowledge graphs is a challenging activity that
   requires the combination of skills in semantic modelling and data
   engineering.  Semantic data models are represented by ontologies and
   other forms of structured knowledge, which must be kept in sync with
   the data pipelines that integrate the different data silos into the
   knowlede graph.  The data integration process is based on the
   ingestion of raw data from their data sources, the mapping of the raw
   data to the respective ontologies, and the transformation of the data
   into a graph structure semantically-annotated.

   In this sense, Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) underpinned by two
   pillars: i) ontology development; and ii) knowledge graph
   construction pipeline.  These pillars are described in detail in the
   following sections.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Data integration: Process of combining data from diverse sources into
   a unified view.

   Data mapping: Technique that defines how data from one data model
   corresponds to another data model.

   Data materialization: Technique that collects data from remote data
   source and persists a copy the data in a target data storage.  This
   process can also be seen as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL).

   Data virtualization: Technique wherein an intermediate component
   (i.e., data virtualization layer) exposes data available in a remote
   data sources without creating an copy of the data.  The data
   virtualization layer keeps pointers to the original location of data,
   so when a data consumer asks for these data, the virtualization layer
   collects the data from the source and directly serves the data to the
   consumer.

   Ontology: Formal, shared representation of knowledge in a domain.

3.  Ontology Development

   Ontologies provide the formal representation of the conceptual models
   that capture the semantics of data, and building on this, the
   integration of data in the knowledge graph.  Ontologies can be
   developed following different techniques, ranging from manual to
   fully automated, depending on the characteristics of the data to be
   integrated in the knowledge graph (e.g., format or schema).

3.1.  Standard Development Methodologies

   Developing an ontology is a challenging task that requires skills in
   knowledge management and semantic modelling.  To ease this process, a
   good practice is to follow mature, proven methodologies that provide
   thorough guidelines and recommend tools that can help in the
   development of an ontology.  An example of these methodologies is
   Linked Open Terms (LOT) [Poveda-Villalon2022].

   LOT is an ontology development methodology that adopts best practices
   from agile software development.  The methodology has been widely
   used in European projects as well as in the creation of the ETSI
   SAREF ontology and its extensions.  Precisely, with SAREF Ontology
   ETSI tackled a similar problem in the scope of IoT, where there is a
   heterogeneous variety of standard data models and protocols.  The
   methodology iterates over a workflow of the following four
   activities:

   1.  ontology requirements specification

   2.  ontology implementation

   3.  ontology publication, and

   4.  ontology maintenance.

   The workflow starts with the specification of requirements that the
   ontology must fulfill.  To that aim, the methodology requires
   collecting knowledge from domain experts, but also by analyzing the
   data sources (e.g., network devices) and schemas for the data (e.g.,
   YANG data models) to be ingested and integrated in the knowledge
   graph.  LOT recommends several approaches such as competency
   questions (CQs), natural language statements, or tabular information
   inspired by METHONTOLOGY.

3.2.  Automatic Knowledge Extraction from YANG Models

   The extraction of knowledge from YANG models could be automated, for
   example, by analyzing YANG identities to generate controlled
   vocabularies and taxonomies.

   [RFC7950] defines a YANG identity as "globally unique, abstract, and
   untyped identity", therefore, a relation between a YANG identity and
   a concept is straightforward.  Additionally, YANG identities can
   inherit from other YANG identities via the "base" statement.  These
   ideas align with the notion of a taxonomy, where concepts are
   hierarchically linked with other concepts.

   To support the creation of knowledge structures like taxonomies or
   thesauri, the W3C standardized the Simple Knowledge Organization
   System (SKOS).  In such ontology, a concept scheme comprises a set of
   concepts that can be linked with other concepts via hierarchical and
   associative relations.  Typically, a YANG model containing YANG
   identities can be represented as an instance of the
   "skos:ConceptScheme" class.  Next, all YANG identities included in a
   YANG model can be represented as "skos:Concept instances" that are
   contained in the concept scheme.  Lastly, those YANG identities that
   include the "base" statement, the respective SKOS concept will
   include a relation "skos:broader" whose range is the SKOS concept
   representing the parent YANG identity.

4.  Knowledge Graph Construction Pipeline

4.1.  Knowledge Objects

   The intrinsic nature of knowledge graphs is to connect as much
   knowledge as possible within certain scope---time and/or space.
   However, not all processes and operations require whole knowledge
   graphs.  For instance, the communication of a piece of telemetry
   data, organized according to NTF [RFC9232], can be repreented as a
   subset of the knowledge graph of all measurements.

   A knowledge object, as defined in [EERVC], consists in a knowledge
   graph subset of an arbitrary size---from single atoms to tens or
   hundreds of triples---that is decorated with metadata to facilitate
   its contextualization.

   Knowledge objects are particularly well suited to enable entities
   that work with knowledge graphs to communicate to each other
   knowledge pieces, obtained from their knowledge graphs or newly
   created from other sources, such as monitoring.  It has been
   demonstrated in [SECDEP].

4.2.  Pipeline Steps

   The construction of a knowledge graph is supported by a data pipeline
   that follows the archetypical Extract-Transform-Load (ETL), wherein
   the raw data is collected from the source(s), transformed, and
   finally, stored for consumption.  The knowledge graph creation
   pipeline can thus be split into multiple steps as depicted in
   Figure 1.

         +-----------+       +---------+       +-----------------+
         |           |       |         |       |                 |
         | Ingestion +------>| Mapping +------>|   Integration   |
         |           | Raw   |         | RDF   |                 |
         +-----------+ data  +---------+ data  +--------+--------+

               |                                        v
         +-----+----+                             +-----------+
         |   Data   |                             | Knowledge |

         +----------+                             +-----------+

                           Construction Pipeline

   These steps are the following: ingestion, mapping, and integration.

4.2.1.  Ingestion

   Represents the first step in the creation of the knowledge graph.
   This step is realized by means of collectors that ingest raw data
   from the selected data source.  These collectors implement data
   access protocols which are specific to the technology and type of the
   data source.  For instance, when it comes to network management
   protocols based on YANG, these protocols can be NETCONF [RFC6241],
   RESTCONF [RFC8040] and gNMI [GNMI].

   Two main types of data sources are identified based on the techniques
   used to ingest the data, namely, batch and streaming.  In the case of
   batch data sources data are pulled (once or periodically) from the
   data source.

   Regarding streaming data sources, the collector subscribes to a YANG
   server to receive notifications of YANG data periodically or upon
   changes in the data source (e.g., a network device whose interface
   goes down).  These subscriptions can be realized, either based on
   configuration or dynamically, using mechanisms like YANG Push
   [RFC8641].  But additionally, another common scenario is the use of
   message broker systems like Apache Kafka for decoupling the ingestion
   of streams of YANG data
   [I-D.netana-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration].  Hence, knowledge
   graph collectors could also support the ingestion of YANG data from
   these kinds of message brokers.

4.2.2.  Mapping

   This second step consists at receiving the raw data data from the
   Ingestion step.  Here, the raw data is mapped to the concepts
   captured in one or more ontologies.  By applying these mapping rules,
   the raw data is semantically annotated and transformed into RDF data.
   Depending on the nature of the raw data, different techniques can
   applied.

   In the case of (semi-)structured data such as tabular data (e.g.,
   CSV, relational databases) or hierarchical data (e.g., JSON, XML)
   these mappings can be defined by using declarative languages like RDF
   Mapping Language (RML) [Iglesias-Molina2023].

   RML is a declarative language that is currently being standardized
   within the W3C Knowledge Graph Construction Community group [W3C-KGC]
   that allows for defining mappings rules for raw data encoded in semi-
   structured formats like XML or JSON.  The benefits of using a
   declarative language like RML are twofold: i) the engine that
   implements the RML rules is generic, thus the mappings rules are
   decoupled from the code; ii) the explicit representation of mapping
   and transformation rules as part of the knowledge graph provides data
   lineage insights that can greatly improve data quality and the
   troubleshooting of data pipelines.  RML is making progress towards
   becoming a standard, but support of additional YANG encoding formats
   like CBOR [RFC8949] or Protobuf remains a challenge.  The knowledge
   payload carried by CBOR and/or Protobuf is organized as knowledge
   objects transmitted by the mapping entities and received by the
   materialization entities.  The use of knowledge objects allows them
   to easily "cut" knowledge graphs into smaller pieces, transmit them,
   and "paste" and/or "glue" the pieces onto the destination knowledge
   graph.  Consistency is retained by making the same ontologies be used
   with the particular knowledge objects.

4.2.3.  Integration

   This is the final step of the knowledge graph creation.  This step
   receives as an input the knowledge object that contains RDF data
   generated in the Mapping step, which has easily manageable semantic
   triples---or quadruples---, as well as metadata to contextualize them
   and facilicate the incorporation of the knwoledge to the local
   knowledge graph storage element.  At this point, the RDF data can be
   sent to an RDF triple store like Apache Jena Fuseki [Fuseki] for
   consumption via SPARQL.  But alternatively, this step may transform
   the RDF data into an LPG structure and store the resulting data in a
   graph database like Neoj4 [Neo4j].  Similarly, the RDF data could
   also be transformed into the ETSI NGSI-LD standard [ETSI-GS-CIM-009]
   and stored in an NGSI-LD Context Broker.

5.  Challenges

   Ontology development:  Time-consuming task that requires skills in
      knowledge management and conceptual modeling.  Additionally,
      ontology developers should maintain a tight coordination with
      domain owners and ontology users.  Following a standard
      methodology like LOT provides guidance in the process but still,
      the development of the ontology requires manual work.  Tools that
      can produce or bootstrap ontologies from existing data models in a
      semi-automatic, or even automatic, are desirable.  In this sense,
      data models could include explicit semantics in the data models,
      in the same way that JSON-LD [JSON-LD] or CSVW [CSVW] include
      metadata indicating which concepts from concepts are referenced by
      the data.

   Pipeline performance:  To integrate the raw data from the original
      data source into the knowledge graph entails several steps as
      described before.  This steps add an extra latency before having
      the data stored in the knowledge graph for consumption.  This
      latency can be an important limitation for real-time analytics use
      cases.

   Scalability:  The knowledge graph must be able to integrate massive
      amounts of data collected from the network.  Distributed and
      federated architectures can improve the scalability of a global,
      composable knowledge graph.  However, these architectures add
      complexity to the management of knowledge graph as well as extra
      latency when federating requests.

   Virtualization:  The common approach for data integration is by
      materializing the data in the knowledge graph, which entails
      duplicating the data.  However, this approach presents multiple
      limitations in terms of data governance and data cadence.
      Regarding data governance, having copies of the original data
      hampers keeping track of all the available data.  With respect to
      data cadence, in particular for batch data sources, data are
      periodically pulled from the source at particular frequency, which
      might not be optimal depending on the use case.  In this sense,
      data virtualization introduces a new data access technique that
      can overcome these limitations.  With this technique, the
      knowledge graph defines pointers to the data at the original
      source, and the KGC pipeline performs the ingestion and mapping of
      the data, and eventually the delivery of data to the consumer,
      only when requested on demand.

6.  Security Considerations

   Access control to data:  The knowledge graph becomes an integrator of
      data, and, in many cases, sensible.  Therefore, data access
      control mechanisms must be present to ensure that only authorized
      consumers can discover and access data from the knowledge graph.
      Access control policies based on roles or attributes are common
      approaches, but additional aspects like sensitivity of data could
      be included in the policy.

   Integrity and authenticity of mappings:  The declaration of mappings
      of raw data to concepts in ontologies is a critical step in the
      knowledge graph construction.  Unauthorized mappings, or even
      tampered mappings, can lead to security breaches and anomalies
      producing a great impact on analytics and machine learning
      applications that consume data from the knowledge graph.  To
      protect consumers from these scenarios, the knowledge graph must
      include mechanisms that verify the correctness, authenticity, and
      integrity of the mappings used in the construction of the graph.
      Only data owners, as accountable of their data, should be
      authorized to define and deploy mappings for the knowledge graph
      construction.

   Data provenance:  Keeping track of the history of data as they go
      through the knowledge graph construction pipeline can improve the
      quality of the data of the knowledge graph.  As part of the
      knowledge graph construction, signatures can be appended to the
      data [I-D.lopez-opsawg-yang-provenance], can help in verifying
      that such data come from the golden data source, and therefore,
      that the data can be trusted.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Open Issues

   *  Should this document provide guidelines for generating URIs of
      nodes/subjects in the knowledge graph?  Take into account there
      are several levels of abstraction device vs network/service level.
      For example, the URI that identifies a network interface cannot be
      generated only from the name of the interface as there could
      conflicts with other interfaces of other network devices having
      the same name.

   *  Implementations?  References to examples based on open-source
      implementations.  Integration with YANG-Push-Kafka architecture.
      Target future hackathons.

Appendix A.  NETCONF Data Sources

   This appendix presents a scenario that demonstrates the construction
   of a knowledge graph based on YANG data collected from a NETCONF
   server.  In particular, the scenario tackles the creation of a data
   catalog based on a knowledge graph that keeps registry of the YANG
   data sources and the YANG data models that they implement.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-library-augmentedby], data
   catalog implementations backed by knowledge graphs provide powerful
   solutions that can easily incorporate additional context to the
   catalog.  As an evolution of the YANG Catalog service, the resulting
   knowledge graph facilitates the navigation across dependencies of
   YANG modules, but more importantly, enables the combination of these
   data with other data silos such as the network topology [RFC8345] or
   network hardware inventory [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].

   To create a knowledge graph that supports the data catalog, the
   proposed approach is based on collecting data from the YANG Library
   from devices running in the network, in this case, from a NETCONF
   server.  For this, the RML engine queries the NETCONF server to
   retrieve the YANG Library data, and then, applies the RML mappings to
   transform the YANG data into RDF according to the target ontology.

   This prototype was conducted as part of the paper "Declarative
   Construction of Knowledge Graphs from NETCONF Data Sources" sent to
   the Semantic Web Journal (currently under review):
   https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/declarative-
   construction-knowledge-graphs-netconf-data-sources-0

A.1.  Prototype Architecture

   A high-level architecture of the prototype that validates the
   implementation is shown below:

      Figure 2: Architecture of prototype to construct knowledge graph
                          from NETCONF data source

   BURP was selected as the open-source implementation of an RML engine
   that was chosen for this prototype.  The NETCONF server is emulated
   using the netopeer2.

A.2.  Target Ontology

   The YANG Library Ontology was developed to represent the
   implementation details of YANG module and submodules, along with
   their interdependencvies, in the different datastores of YANG server.
   The ontology was developed following the LOT methodology and is
   publicly available at: https://w3id.org/yang/library

   The code of the ontology and all related artifacts are publicly
   available on GitHub: https://github.com/candil-data-fabric/yang-
   library-ontology

A.3.  KGC Pipeline

   In addition to the YANG Library Ontology, the YANG Server Ontology
   was developed to represent YANG data sources such as NETCONF servers
   and operations to retrieve data from them such as queries or
   subscriptions.  Similarly, this ontology was developed following the
   LOT methodology and is publicly available at: https://w3id.org/yang/
   server

   The code of the ontology and all related artifacts are publicly
   available on GitHub: https://github.com/candil-data-fabric/yang-
   server-ontology

   The YANG Server Ontology is used in combination with the RML
   vocabulary to describe the access to YANG servers, from which the
   collected data are transformed into RDF.  In this sense, BURP was
   extendended to support the ingestion of YANG data from NETCONF
   servers using NETCONF queries.

   The following subsections include excerpts of the raw XML data
   (Figure 3), RML mappings (Figure 4), and final RDF data (Figure 3).
   The complete examples can be found on: https://github.com/candil-
   data-fabric/yang-library-ontology/tree/main/knowledge-graph/xpath
